# 🌀 Analysis of the Biggest Atlantic Hurricanes Dataset 🌪️

Welcome to the repository! This project focuses on analysing the **Biggest Atlantic Hurricanes Dataset** using absolute cell referencing in Excel. The main goal of this project is to identify the maximum wind speeds for each hurricane category.

## 📊 Project Overview

In this project, I worked with a dataset containing information about the largest hurricanes in the Atlantic. The analysis primarily involves:

- Using **absolute cell referencing** to perform data analysis in Excel.
- Identifying the **maximum wind speeds** for each hurricane category (Category 1, 2, 3, 4, 5).
- Presenting the results clearly and efficiently.

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies

- **Microsoft Excel** for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Absolute Cell Referencing** in Excel to lock specific cell values for better accuracy in formulas.

## 📝 Steps Followed

1. **Dataset Preparation**: Cleaned the data to ensure it was in a proper format for analysis.
2. **Absolute Cell Referencing**: Applied absolute cell referencing to ensure accurate and consistent calculations across the dataset.
3. **Wind Speed Calculation**: Identified and extracted the maximum wind speed for each hurricane category.

## 💡 Key Takeaways

Absolute cell referencing in Excel makes complex calculations more reliable and consistent across datasets.
This analysis helped in identifying the highest wind speeds for each hurricane category and understanding the impact of different hurricane intensities.
